---

## 1. Executive Summary & Architectural Invariants

The engineering team has executed **Phase 24B (Platform Problem Intelligence Explorer Surface)** in strict compliance with **Architecture Release AR-13A.0** and the **Platform Beta Operating Doctrine** (`AGENTS.md`):

1. **Projection Boundary Safeguard Invariant**:
   - Problem Intelligence Explorer projects, composes, and connects existing canonical Knowledge Objects (`CHAPTER_1_FIX`, `Claim`, `Evidence`, `Source`, `Entity`, `Dataset`, `Law`) without introducing duplicate persistence or mutating canonical truth (*"Problem Intelligence projects. Problem Intelligence composes. Problem Intelligence connects. Problem Intelligence never duplicates canonical data."*).
   - All problem nodes, root cause graphs, evidence spines, policy evaluations, and fix readiness metrics remain 100% immutable and non-mutating.

2. **10 Architectural Refinements Implemented**:
   - **Pure Projection Composition Layer (`lib/explorer/problem-projection.ts`)**: `ProblemIntelligenceProjectionBuilder` deriving immutable `ProblemIntelligenceProjection` without parallel DB schemas.
   - **Problem as Primary Graph Hub (`lib/explorer/problem-explorer-service.ts`)**: `ProblemExplorerService` mapping problem nodes to root causes, claims, evidence, sources, policies, laws, fixes, stories, entities, and datasets.
   - **Evidence-Based Overview (`components/explorer/ProblemExplorerPanel.tsx`)**: Overview cards composed from canonical claims, evidence, affected sectors, and principal actors.
   - **Navigable Interactive Root-Cause Graph (`components/explorer/ProblemDetailView.tsx`)**: Expandable root cause nodes displaying connected evidence, stories, policies, datasets, and entities.
   - **Evidence Spine Provenance (`components/explorer/ProblemDetailView.tsx`)**: Sequenced provenance displaying `Claim` → `Evidence` → `Primary Source` → `Verification` → `Publication`.
   - **Policy Evaluation Matrix (`components/explorer/ProblemDetailView.tsx`)**: Separates policy description, implementation status, supporting evidence, observed outcomes, linked fixes, and evidence gaps.
   - **Multi-Domain Graph Search (`lib/explorer/problem-projection.ts`)**: Search spanning titles, sectors, and principal actors.
   - **First-Class Reader Onboarding Guidance (`components/explorer/ProblemDetailView.tsx`)**: Embedded learning path guide ("New to this issue? Start with investigation → Understand causes → Review evidence → Compare fixes").
   - **Structured SEO Metadata (`app/problems/page.tsx` & `app/problems/[slug]/page.tsx`)**: `BreadcrumbList`, `Article`, `DefinedTerm`, OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, and canonical URLs.
   - **Expanded Test Suite (`tests/problem-explorer.test.ts`)**: 16 unit tests covering problem node composition, root cause traversal, evidence spine mapping, policy evaluation, projection immutability, non-mutation guarantees, and UI rendering logic.
